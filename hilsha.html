                    Few years back, I migrated from Bangladesh to Canada to persue my canadian dream. After coming here,
                    the thing I missed most from my homeland is the food. Often, I have hopped around Toronto looking
                    for ethnic Bangladeshi food to serve my cravings. My personal experience and background has helped
                    me to empathize with other immigrants who miss their ethnic comfort food. Very recently,
                    when I was doing "Google UX Design Certification", I took the opportunity to hone my skills to
                    design a product that serve the need of Bangladeshi immigrants in Toronto.

                <p>It was mid June 2020. Canada was in itâ€™s third month of lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. I
                    was
                    a
                    student then and as a part of my class project, <span>
                        I redesigned the grocery shopping experience of Metro Inc
                    </span> which is the
                    third largest grocer
                    in Canada. I was particularly interested for the topic, as during the lockdown, I noticed a
                    significant
                    change in
                    the grocery shopping behaviour among my friends, family and specifically in myself. I shifted to
                    eating
                    at home,
                    limited the frequency of store visits, became more dependent on online purchase. So I was
                    curious to
                    know the newly evolved grocery shopping experience.
