                    I moved to Calgary in November 2021. To recover from winter boredom and from the fear of missing out
                    the latest Marvel
                    craze, I went to a theatre of Landmark Cinemas (second largest cinema chain in Canada after
                    Cineplex) to watch Eternals.
                    Being a person who likes to plan everything ahead, I reserved my tickets online from it’s website.
                    Though the expereince
                    of the theatre was good, I didn’t found the experience of using the website very pleasant as a user.
                    As a designer, I
                    saw many flaws and usability issues as well. In consequence, to soothe my designer soul and as a
                    part of my second
                    portfolio project in Googles UX Design Certification, I decided the redesign the website.

            <!-- painpoint one -->

            <p class="landmarkWrapper landmarkPainpoints">1. Selecting Theatre in the Begining</p>
            <p class="landmarkSectionText landmarkWrapper"> From the user research, I identified two main user stories
                of movie-goers.
                For
                an example, first is for the people who are looking
                for a good time to watch the new Justice League movie (they have a specific movie in mind). Second is
                the people who are looking for a nice movie to watch during Saturday afternoon (they have a specific
                time in mind). But, the current userflow does not serve this user stories properly because it starts
                with selecting a particular theatre at first. Research indicates that user selects a particular theater
                depending
                on it's location, convenient screen time and avaialbility of favorite movie. Their mental model is more
                like "Lets see when I can watch Spider Man" or "Lets see what movie I can watch on Saturday Evening" but
                not like "Lets see what movie is available in Calgary Country Hill Theatre". So, selecting a particular
                theatre as a early step doesn't match with their mental model. This analysis indicated that the user
                flow of current website needs to be rearranged.

            <p class="landmarkWrapper landmarkPainpoints">2. Selecting Seats</p>
            <p class="landmarkSectionText landmarkWrapper"> During the usability study, a major of the frustrations came
                from the fact that user finally choose the right screening time and movie for them, only to
                realize there are no relevant available seats of their choice. This painpoint gave me a hint that user
                should get the idea of seat arangement in a earlier step of user flow.

            <p class="landmarkWrapper landmarkPainpoints">3. Clumpsy UI Design </p>
            <p class="landmarkSectionText landmarkWrapper"> During the usability study, users found the design very
                clumpsy and performaing the basic use cases was not quite intuitive for them. From the heuristics
                analysis, I
                realized the website lacks visual hierarchy and hence fails to guide users follow the content. Also, I
                saw there are oceans of content which made me reliaze that the information should be reorganized for
                designing a better layout.

                    So I shared the prototype with one of my friend and ask him to explain the UI and perform a use case
                    where he buys the movie ticket of "Dune". The testing did not unveil any more insights but my friend
                    was able to perform the use case and explain well whats happening in the UI. That means the design
                    was not complicated.

            <p class="landmarkSectionText">Redesigning Landmark's website was a great satisfaction as this is one
                website I
                regularly use for reserving movie tickets. Also, in my design career, I have mostly used Figma, Sketch
                and Invision for making
                wireframe, mockups and interactive prototype. This is the first time when I have used Adobe XD as a
                design tool. Trying a new tool definitely inreased my adaptibility and strengthen my opinion towards
                the features of each of them. As this was the MVP for my project, I designed only the desktop version of
                the website. In next iteration, I would like to design the website for smaller screen sizes. </p>
