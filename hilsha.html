                    Few years back, I migrated from Bangladesh to Canada to persue my canadian dream. After coming here,
                    the thing I missed most from my homeland is the food. Often, I have hopped around Toronto looking
                    for ethnic Bangladeshi food to serve my cravings. And it has not been very convenient every time.
                    My personal experience and background has helped me to empathize with other immigrants like me who
                    miss their ethnic comfort food. So very recently, when I was doing "Google UX Design Certification",
                    I took the opportunity to hone my skills to design a product that serve the needs related to the
                    food
                    habit of Bangladeshi
                    immigrants in Toronto.

            <p class="hilshaSectionText"> Since I followed "Design Thinking" framework, I started things off by
                interviewing 6 people in Toronto who have migrated from Bangladesh. At the beginning of this project, I
                was un-sure with what route to take. So, I used these interviews to gather basic insights about
                anything and everything about their food habit and identify common painpoints. Then I used few UX tools
                i.e. empathy map, persona, user jourey mapping to define the problem statement and also used those in
                the ideation
                phase to come up with solutions.

                miss their ethnic Bangladeshi food and have their reasons for not being able to cook those. But Fahrina
                relies on some local caterers who cooks & sells ethnic Bangladeshi comfort food from their home, and
                Rashid relies on local Bangladeshi Restaurant. I felt painpoints related to ordering food from caterers
                is rather more unexplored by existing products in the market. So, I decided to narrow down my focus on
                the user group like fahrina.

                website/app.They mostly sells their food via word of mouth and marketplace, community groups, pages in
                Facebook. So
                I decided to explore some of these caterers in Facebook community groups and pages. I also explored the
                website and facebook page of the restaurants who serves ethnic Bangladeshi food in Toronto. Combining
                these
                insights with the ones I got from the user interviews I came up with a value proposition for
                my product. My goal was to come up with as many ideas as possible.

            </div>
            <p class="hilshaSectionText">I conducted the usability test of my low-fidelity prototype with 2 of
                participants that I interviewed before. Both of them have previous experience of ordering Bangladeshi
                ethnic food from the local caterers of Toronto. I asked them to perform few basic use cases and also
                some questions like:
            </p>

            <ul class="hilshaList">
                <li>1. What do you see in each screen and what you understand by those? </li>
                <li>2. What do you like and don't like about it?</li>
                <li>3. Do you have any suggestion?</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="hilshaSectionText">From the test, I found the following major insights:
            </p>

            <ul class="hilshaList">
                <li> 1. The Home screen displays list of caterers including their availability. But this
                    availability varies a lot from one caterer to other. Instead of seeing the list of all caterers,
                    what if users want to see those who is available for today/ tomorrow or next 4-7 days? In this case,
                    users have to click/explore every
                    caterer which will make the experience cumbersome. As a solution, I came up with a idea where the
                    home screen will initially
                    display caterers who is avaialble for next 3 days. Users will also have the liberty to change it
                    from 3 days to
                    the time frame they want. </li>
                <li> 2. After adding item to the cart (screen 2), user clicks "Checkout" button in screen 3 to
                    proceed. But what if
                    user does not want to checkout with the item he has selected in the cart? What if they want to
                    change the item in the cart and start browsing again? As a solution, I came up with a additional
                    screen called where user can view and edit their cart.</li>

            <p class="hilshaSectionText">This project made me realize more and more about the importance of
                understanding the user and how much it can impact and guide in each steps of UX design process. I
                would like to thank Google for making amazing content in it's "UX Design Certification" which helped me
                a lot to hone my skills in building the UX tools I used to understand my users.</p>
