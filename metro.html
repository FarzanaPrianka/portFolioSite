                    It was mid June 2020. Canada was in it’s third month of lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Then,
                    I
                    was
                    a
                    student of Juno College of Technology, Toronto. As a part of my class project,
                    <span class="metroEmphasis">
                        I redesigned the grocery shopping experience of Metro
                        which is the
                        third largest grocer
                        in Canada.
                    </span> I was particularly interested for the topic, as during the lockdown, I noticed a
                    significant
                    change in
                    the grocery shopping behaviour among my friends, family and specifically in myself. I shifted to
                    eating
                    at home,
                    limited the frequency of store visits, became more dependent on online purchase. So I was
                    curious to
                    know the newly evolved grocery shopping experience.

                        the shopping time.

                <p class="metroSectionText">Research indicated that, as per the existing mental model, users expect a
                    search bar when they land in the home page of
                    an app. During the usability test, it seemed a long-winded task for users just to find out that
                    there is a “Shop online
                    on metro.ca” link which they needs to click to get access to the search bar

                <p class="metroSectionText">Also, the content of the app seemed scattered enough that users had
                    difficulty in some basic product search related use
                    cases such as product search by category/ sale.

                <p class="metroSectionText">To make the product browse experience more seemless, I decided to make

            <p class="metroSectionText">As a part of User Expereince Design Course, Juno College of Technology arranged
                a usability testing sessions for their cohort where they invited their alumni to test their student's
                prototype. In this session, my prototype got tested by 2 participants which gave me insights that there
                still room for improvement. What about those users who wants to check the aisle no. of a long list of
                grocery items during their grocery visit?
                Let's say for 20 items, he has to search 20 times.Why not showing the information in one place?

                    visits; either in text, paper or on mobile. In my
                    design, I included a feature where users can make a list of grocery, and view the stock availability
                    in one place.

            <p class="metroSectionText">It was the very first time for me working as a designer in a UX case study. I
                spent quite amount of
                time
                discussing and reviewing my research and design decisions with the amazing mentors of Juno College
                of
                technology who is working as UX industry experts. I learnt how to effectively convey my rationale
                and
                justify the design during the discussions back-and-forth, and it drove the entire project
                towards a better direction.</p>
